<p>The Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) is a framework of several services.
It is developed as part of the commercial product line <a class="reference external" href="https://www.greenbone.net/en/solutions/">Greenbone Professional Edition</a>.</p>
<p>GVM was originally built as a community project named <a class="reference external" href="https://openvas.org/">OpenVAS</a> and is
primarily developed and forwarded by Greenbone Networks.</p>
<p>The following figure shows an overview of the architecture for GVM 20.08 and
GVM 21.04.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Greenbone, GVM, OpenVAS and How They Are Connected</a><a class="headerlink" href="#greenbone-gvm-openvas-and-how-they-are-connected" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the OpenVAS project was launched, it only consisted of an engine for scanning
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, Greenbone Networks was founded to achieve
professional support for vulnerability scanning. Greenbone started to lead the
development of OpenVAS, added several software components and turned OpenVAS into a
vulnerability management solution while keeping the values of free software.</p>
<p>After several years, it became obvious that using OpenVAS as the brand name for
the open source project and funding of almost the entire development of the project
was not recognized from the outside. Therefore, after the release of the OpenVAS 9
framework, it got renamed to <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-GVM"><span class="xref std std-term">Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM)</span></a>
and released as <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-GSE"><span class="xref std std-term">Greenbone Source Edition (GSE)</span></a>. Since GVM 10, the
term OpenVAS is only used for the scanner component as it was at the beginning
of the project.</p>

<section id="history-of-the-openvas-project">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">History of the OpenVAS project</a><a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-the-openvas-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2005, the developers of the vulnerability scanner Nessus decided to
discontinue the work under Open Source licenses and switch to a proprietary
business model.</p>
<p>At this point, developers from Intevation and DN-Systems – the two companies
which would later found Greenbone Networks – were already contributing
developments to Nessus, focusing on client tools. The works were primarily
supported by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).</p>
<p>In 2006, several forks of Nessus were created in response to the
discontinuation of the Open Source solution. Of these forks, only one has continued
to show activity: OpenVAS, the Open Vulnerability Assessment System. OpenVAS was
registered as a project at Software in the Public Interest, Inc. to hold and
protect the domain “openvas.org”.</p>
<p>The years 2006 and 2007 brought little activity other than cleanups of the status quo.
But in late 2008, the company Greenbone Networks GmbH, based in Osnabrück,
Germany was founded to drive OpenVAS forward. Essentially, Greenbone’s business
plan was about 3 cornerstones:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Go beyond plain vulnerability scanning towards a comprehensive
vulnerability management solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a turn-key appliance product for enterprise customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue the Open Source concept of creating a transparent security
technology.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Also in 2008, two further companies became active: Secpod from India and
Security Space from Canada. Both of them had a focus on contributing
vulnerability tests, and teamed up with Greenbone Networks to start producing
a reliable and up-to-date feed of vulnerability tests. This started with removing
any source code and vulnerability tests where the license was not clear or not
compatible. Several thousands of vulnerability tests were eliminated to get a clean
starting point. Shortly after, the feed content grew quickly and steadily.</p>
<p>In 2009, Greenbone added the first additional modules to build a vulnerability
management solution. The web interface and the central management service were
developed from scratch, with generic protocols defined as their API. At the same
time, the OpenVAS scanner was carefully improved and quickly lost compatibility
with its ancestor. All Open Source work was branded “OpenVAS”. The first
“Greenbone Security Manager” appliance products entered the market in spring 2010.</p>
<p>In the years 2010 to 2016, the commercial product was systematically improved
and extended, and so were the Open Source modules. The vulnerability
management was extended to include daily updated security advisories, which were
made available to the public with a GPL-compatible license by the German CERTs
DFN-CERT and CERT-Bund, a division of the BSI.</p>
<p>In March 2017, the OpenVAS framework reached version 9. Many new
modules and numerous features were added during the release cycles. Several hundreds
of thousands of lines of code were produced and there was almost no day without a
couple of released code improvements by a growing development team.</p>
<p>The year 2017 marked the beginning of a new era: first of all, Greenbone Networks became
visible as the driving force behind OpenVAS, reducing the brand confusion. This
included several activities, the most essential one being the renaming of the
“OpenVAS framework” to <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-GVM"><span class="xref std std-term">Greenbone Vulnerability Management” (GVM)</span></a>,
of which the OpenVAS Scanner is one of many modules. It also led to “GVM-10” as
the successor of “OpenVAS-9”. There were no license changes, all modules remained
Open Source.</p>
<p>The second major change in 2017 involved the feed service. Apart from the
branding confusion, several companies integrated the technology and feed, passing
it off as their work or claiming to be an alternative to Greenbone’s
product at a better price. Only a minority of them properly complied with the
GPL licenses. None of them cooperates with Greenbone Networks commercially. To achieve
better visibility, less misunderstanding, and better differentiation from
other OpenVAS-based products, the public feed was renamed to
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-GCF"><span class="xref std std-term">Greenbone Community Feed</span></a> and the feed development was internalized.
Furthermore, the release scheme has been changed from a 14-day delay to a daily
publication without delay, now excluding vulnerability tests for enterprise products.</p>
<p>The third major change to the new era was the transition to a modern
infrastructure, namely GitHub and a community forum. The whole transition was
completed in 2018 and boosted both productivity and community activity.</p>
<p>In 2019, the branding separation was completed. OpenVAS now represents the actual
vulnerability scanner, as it did originally, and the “S” in “OpenVAS” now stands
for “Scanner” rather than “System”. These changes were accompanied by an updated
OpenVAS logo. The framework in which OpenVAS is embedded is the Greenbone
Vulnerability Management (GVM).</p>
<p>OpenVAS released with GVM-10 received numerous performance optimization to
meet the challenge of a growing number of vulnerability tests scanning
target networks of increasing size and heterogeneity.</p>
<p>OpenVAS released with GVM-11 introduced substantial architectural changes: the
former service <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-openvassd"><span class="xref std std-term">openvassd</span></a> was turned into a command-line tool
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-openvas"><span class="xref std std-term">openvas</span></a>. It is controlled by the service layer <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-ospd-openvas"><span class="xref std std-term">ospd-openvas</span></a>.
This concept essentially replaces the old stateful, permanent and proprietary
OTP (OpenVAS Transfer Protocol) by the new stateless, request-response
XML-based and generic <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-OSP"><span class="xref std std-term">OSP (Open Scanner Protocol)</span></a>.</p>
