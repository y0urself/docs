The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Tools, or *gvm-tools* in short, are a
collection of tools that help with controlling the Greenbone Vulnerability
Management stack remotely.

Essentially, the tools aid accessing the communication protocols
:term:`Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP)<GMP>` and
:term:`Open Scanner Protocol (OSP)<OSP>`.

*gvm-tools* are optional and not required for a functional GVM stack.

.. note::

  *gvm-tools* is released independently of the GVM framework. Therefore, the
  newest version is used.
